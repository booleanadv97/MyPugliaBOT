# Dialogflow Intents

- Intents in Dialogflow represent users’ intentions in a conversation. Each intent contains training phrases that the agent uses to recognize similar inputs.
- To import intents, download the JSON files containing the desired intents. Then, in the console, select the ‘Upload intent’ option and follow the instructions.
- Remember that intents with many training phrases work better; add additional training phrases beyond the provided ones to make the bot more effective and efficient.
